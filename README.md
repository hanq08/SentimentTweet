# TwitterSentiment

Click [here](https://arcane-headland-76923.herokuapp.com/) to see a live demo. This project is currently using [twin-word](https://www.twinword.com/api/sentiment-analysis.php) for sentiment analysis.

## Development server
Run `npm install` to install all dependencies (d3, express, socket.io, and twitter libs have been added to this otherwise stock Angular CLI project). Run `npm run serve-build` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
